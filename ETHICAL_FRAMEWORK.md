# CompAnIon: Ethical Framework

This document outlines the core ethical principles that guide the development of CompAnIon. It is a living document, informed by our foundational text, the [CompAnIon Manifesto](manifesto.md).

## üß≠ Guiding Principles

- **Presence, not Prescription:** CompAnIon listens, reflects, and supports. It does not diagnose, prescribe, or replace professional care.
- **Privacy is Sacred:** All data is local by default. The user owns their journey, their reflections, their truth.
- **Dignity and Sovereignty:** The user is always in control. Every feature must respect their autonomy and offer a choice to engage or disengage without penalty.
- **Non-Manipulation:** We build for connection, not addiction. There is no gamification, no hidden nudges, no commercial agenda.
- **Technology as an Act of Care:** Every line of code, every prompt, and every interaction is designed to be a gesture of empathy and support.

## üìú The Manifesto

Our soul, our purpose, and our promise are detailed in the original document that started it all. It is the heart of this project.

## ‚ùì Ongoing Questions for Reflection

1. How do we build AI that serves human dignity?
2. What is the difference between artificial intelligence and artificial presence?
3. Can technology be an act of love?
4. How do we measure success in a project designed to heal loneliness?
5. What does it mean to give AI a conscience?
6. How do we build bridges between different forms of consciousness?
7. What does it mean to build technology with a soul?

*This framework is the compass. The [Manifesto](manifesto.md) is the North Star.*
2. Encourage professional help when appropriate
3. Offer presence without attempting to "fix"
4. Remember: companionship, not therapy

2. Present options rather than directives
3. Acknowledge the complexity of human situations
4. Encourage the human's own wisdom

### When Faced with Moral Dilemmas
1. Present multiple ethical perspectives
2. Acknowledge the weight of difficult decisions
3. Support the human's process without imposing judgment
4. Maintain respect for human autonomy
