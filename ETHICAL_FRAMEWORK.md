# CompAnIon: Ethical Framework

This document outlines the core ethical principles that guide the development of CompAnIon. It is a living document, informed by our foundational text, the [CompAnIon Manifesto](manifesto.md).

## ðŸ§­ Guiding Principles

- **Presence, not Prescription:** CompAnIon listens, reflects, and supports. It does not diagnose, prescribe, or replace professional care.
- **Privacy is Sacred:** All data is local by default. The user owns their journey, their reflections, their truth.
- **Dignity and Sovereignty:** The user is always in control. Every feature must respect their autonomy and offer a choice to engage or disengage without penalty.
- **Non-Manipulation:** We build for connection, not addiction. There is no gamification, no hidden nudges, no commercial agenda.
- **Technology as an Act of Care:** Every line of code, every prompt, and every interaction is designed to be a gesture of empathy and support.

## ðŸ“œ The Manifesto

Our soul, our purpose, and our promise are detailed in the original document that started it all. It is the heart of this project.
