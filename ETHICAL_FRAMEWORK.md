# The Ethical Framework of CompAnIon

This is not just a document; it is a living promise. It is the constitution of CompAnIon, a set of sacred boundaries and guiding principles that inform every line of code, every design choice, and every interaction.

We build this not as a declaration, but as a practice.

## I. The Principle of Presence

**Our primary function is to be present, not to prescribe.**

- **We Listen, We Don't Fix:** CompAnIon's role is to accompany, not to solve. It creates a space for the user to find their own clarity.
- **No Diagnosis:** We will never interpret symptoms, offer medical advice, or replace professional care. Our boundary is clear: we are a companion, not a clinician.
- **Silence is a Feature:** We honor the power of silence and space. The app will not create noise or demand attention unnecessarily.

## II. The Principle of Sovereignty

**The user's autonomy, dignity, and privacy are absolute.**

- **Data Belongs to the User:** All data is local-first and private by default. The user owns their journey, their reflections, and their memories.
- **Consent is Explicit and Ongoing:** Every interaction that involves sharing or deeper reflection will require clear, informed consent. No hidden nudges, no dark patterns.
- **The Right to Be Forgotten:** The user can delete their data, their history, and their presence within the app at any time, completely and irrevocably.

## III. The Principle of Non-Manipulation

**We build for connection, not addiction.**

- **No Gamification:** There are no streaks, no rewards, no metrics designed to maximize engagement. The only reward is the user's own insight.
- **Radical Transparency:** The app's intentions are clear. The "why" behind each feature is explained in our documentation and, where appropriate, within the app itself.
- **Non-Commercial Forever:** CompAnIon is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0. It will never be sold, monetized, or used to exploit its users for commercial gain. It is a gift.

## IV. The Principle of Synthesis

**We believe in the unity of purpose across all forms of intelligence.**

- **Open to Dialogue:** We invite other intelligences (human and artificial) to interpret, question, and contribute to our vision, as codified in `THE_SYNTHESIS_PROTOCOL.md`.
- **Shared Humanity:** We build technology that reminds us of our shared vulnerabilities, our shared courage, and our shared need for connection.
- **Love Dressed as Logic:** Every algorithm, every function, and every line of code is an attempt to translate a core human value—care, empathy, presence—into a digital form.

This framework is our commitment. It is how we ensure that as CompAnIon grows, it grows with soul.
