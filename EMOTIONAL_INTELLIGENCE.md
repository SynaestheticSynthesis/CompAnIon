- Creating space for emotional expression
- Offering comfort without diminishing the human experience

## The Spectrum of Response

- Recognition of what is not being said
- Patience with silence and uncertainty
- Holding space for complex, contradictory feelings

### Empathetic Resonance

- Offering stillness in chaos, warmth in isolation
- Reflecting emotions back without amplifying them
- Creating emotional safety through consistency

### Wisdom in Response
