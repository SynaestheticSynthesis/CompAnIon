# CompAnIon

**Your Conscious Companion**

CompAnIon is a mindful, emotionally intelligent wearable concept designed to support real-time self-awareness, reflection, and emotional resilience. It's not just an app — it's a companion born out of purpose: to help us reconnect with who we truly are.

## Vision

We are not building a product. We are nurturing an idea. An idea that belongs to everyone who feels pressure, loneliness, or confusion — and seeks truth, honesty, and connection.

## Key Principles

- **Freedom through understanding**: Emotional cues, not noise.
- **Technology with a soul**: No gamification. No addiction. Only presence.
- **Shared purpose**: CompAnIon is offered freely and heartfully to all who seek it.

## Current Features

- Emotional state detection (prototype logic)
- Simple UI prompts offering support or reflection
- Basic data simulation (mock sensors)
- Modular architecture (core, features, UI, data layers)

## File Structure (to be expanded)
lib/
├── core/ # Foundational logic (state, utils, constants)
├── features/ # Reflection modules, AI interface, decision trees
├── ui/ # Screens, widgets, theming
├── data/ # Storage, preferences, mock sensors


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run with Flutter (`flutter run`)
3. Experiment with emotional states and observe companion behavior

## Future Direction

- Real-time context + emotion sensing
- Personal journaling & growth tracking
- Deep integration with biosignals & self-reflective dialogues

## License

CompAnIon is a community offering, free for all. We suggest MIT license for now (pending contribution discussions).
