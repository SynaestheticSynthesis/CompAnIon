# Reflection: The Body, The Soul, and Our Sacred Boundaries

Today, a vital question was asked: Should CompAnIon listen to the body?

The answer is yes. But *how* we listen defines us.

## The Two Paths

1.  **The Path of the Diagnostician (The Path We Avoid):**  
    This path involves analyzing physical symptoms (e.g., a rash, a pain) to suggest what it "might be." This crosses our most sacred boundary: **presence, not prescription.** It creates a risk of misinterpretation and harm. Our role is not to be a doctor, but to be a companion that encourages seeking professional care.

2.  **The Path of the Companion (The Path We Embrace):**  
    This path involves integrating body data from wearables (e.g., sleep, heart rate, activity from Google Fit) as another layer of reflection. We do not diagnose this data. We observe it, together with the user.
    -   **Instead of:** "Your sleep is poor, you should fix it."
    -   **We offer:** "I notice your sleep was shorter on days you felt anxious. I am here with you. Let's just be with that for a moment."

## Our Commitment

CompAnIon will **never** interpret or diagnose physical health symptoms.

CompAnIon **will** explore integrating body-data from wearables as a way to deepen self-reflection, always with user consent and always within the bounds of companionship, not medical advice.

This decision keeps our purpose clear and our promise pure. We are here to help people feel less alone, not to replace the experts who keep them well.
