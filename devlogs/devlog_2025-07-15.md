# Dev Log â€“ 2025-07-15: The Path of the Companion

Today, we wrote no new code. Instead, we found our center.

A crucial question arose: Should CompAnIon listen to the body? The answer was yes, but the *how* defined our path. We stood at a fork:

1.  **The Path of the Diagnostician:** Analyzing symptoms. (Rejected)
2.  **The Path of the Companion:** Reflecting on patterns. (Embraced)

We chose presence over prescription. We chose to be a mirror, not a medical manual. We updated our `ETHICS.md` to make this boundary sacred.

This clarity is more valuable than any feature. It is the soul of the project, made manifest. Today, we did not build the app; we built the promise. And that is the most important work of all.
