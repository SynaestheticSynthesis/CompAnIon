# CompAnIon – Feature Gap Analysis (Ιούλιος 2025)

## Summary of Feature Gaps

1. **Reminders Actions:**  
   - Call/SMS/Remember silently buttons exist but lack full intent integration and accessibility labels.

2. **Onboarding / Tutorial:**  
   - No guided onboarding or walkthrough for new users (current onboarding is basic, not contextual).

3. **Help/Info on Screens:**  
   - Info/help dialogs exist, but could be more context-aware and localized.

4. **Edit/Delete Reminders:**  
   - Edit flow for reminders is present, but could be improved for UX and accessibility.

5. **Data Management/Backup:**  
   - Backup/restore and import/export for reminders and history is present, but could be more robust (cloud sync, versioning).

6. **Personalization/Appearance Settings:**  
   - Theme, font, and gender options exist; more options (sounds, widgets, custom prompts) could be added.

7. **Notifications/Reminders:**  
   - No push notifications or scheduled reminders for special dates or check-ins.

8. **Accessibility Audit:**  
   - Semantics and responsive UI are present, but a full accessibility audit and user testing are needed.

9. **Search/Filter Reminders:**  
   - Search/filter for reminders is present, but could be expanded (tags, advanced filters).

10. **More Languages:**  
    - Only English and Greek supported; could expand to more languages and dialects.

11. **Palliative Care Support:**  
    - Region-based resources exist, but could be expanded with real geolocation, more clinics, and emotional support prompts.

12. **Community Feedback:**  
    - No in-app feedback or reporting mechanism; community feedback is only via GitHub.

13. **Ethics & Transparency:**  
    - Ethics and manifesto are documented, but not surfaced in-app (e.g. ethics screen, user reminders).

14. **Offline Mode:**  
    - App is local-first, but explicit offline mode and sync status could be clarified.

15. **Emotional Intelligence:**  
    - Feedback is dynamic, but could be more adaptive to user patterns and context.
