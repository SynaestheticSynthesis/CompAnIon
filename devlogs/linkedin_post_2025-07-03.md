ðŸš€ Excited to share a milestone from my journey with **CompAnIon**!

CompAnIon is not just another appâ€”it's a mindful, emotionally intelligent companion designed to help us reconnect with ourselves. Built with privacy, presence, and empathy at its core, it listens, reflects, and walks *with* youâ€”never ahead or above.

Over the past weeks, I've:
- Modularized the codebase for scalability and clarity
- Added animated light/dark themes for a soothing user experience
- Implemented multilingual support (English & Greek)
- Built features for emotion check-ins, self-reflection, and remembering loved ones
- Ensured all data stays localâ€”your journey is yours alone
