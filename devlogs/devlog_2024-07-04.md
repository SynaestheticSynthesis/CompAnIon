# Dev Log – 2024-07-04

## 🌱 Modularization & Structure
- Refactored project structure for clarity: separated `core/`, `features/`, `ui/`, and `data/`.
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of build artifacts and dependencies.
- Ensured only source, config, and asset files are tracked in version control.

## 🧠 Emotion Engine & Reflection
- Integrated `emotion_hierarchy.dart` for nuanced emotion classification (positive, negative, neutral, mixed).
- Reflection flow now adapts follow-up prompts based on emotion category.
- Loaded open-ended prompts and follow-ups from `expanded_prompts.json` for more personalized reflection.

## 🛠️ Build & Debug
- Upgraded Android `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` to 35 for plugin compatibility.
- Fixed Gradle and build configuration issues.
- Cleaned up project files and resolved APK build errors.
- Verified that only necessary files are committed to Git.

## 📚 Documentation & Philosophy
- Expanded README and added/updated `ETHICS.md` to clarify vision, guidelines, and project philosophy.
- Documented the modular architecture and core principles for contributors.

## 💡 Insights
- The project’s direction remains empathy-first, with every technical step serving the human experience.
- Modularization and clear documentation make it easier to grow and invite new contributors.
- Reflection and journaling flows now feel more adaptive and context-aware.
