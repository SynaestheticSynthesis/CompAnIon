# Bug Report: file_picker plugin incompatibility with latest Flutter/Android

## Summary

When building a Flutter app with the latest stable Flutter and Android embedding, the `file_picker` plugin (even older versions like 5.x) fails to build for Android.  
The error is related to usage of the deprecated v1 embedding (`PluginRegistry.Registrar`) which is no longer supported.

## Error Output

```
error: cannot find symbol
    public static void registerWith(final io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.Registrar registrar) {
                                                                 ^
  symbol:   class Registrar
  location: interface PluginRegistry
...
Execution failed for task ':file_picker:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac'.
> Compilation failed; see the compiler output below.
```

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Add `file_picker` (any recent version) to `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Run `flutter build apk` (with Flutter 3.19+ and Android Gradle plugin 7.3+).
4. Observe build failure with above error.

## Platform

- Flutter: 3.19+ (stable)
- Android Gradle Plugin: 7.3+
- Dart: 3.8+
- file_picker: 5.x and 6.x (all tested versions)

## Impact

- App cannot be built for Android (release or debug).
- The plugin is unusable for any Flutter project targeting current stable Flutter.

## Suggested Fix

- Remove all references to `PluginRegistry.Registrar` and v1 embedding from the plugin codebase.
- Ensure the plugin uses only v2 embedding and is compatible with the latest Flutter and Android Gradle plugin.
- Provide a patch release for users.

## Temporary Workaround

- Remove `file_picker` from dependencies until a fixed version is released.
