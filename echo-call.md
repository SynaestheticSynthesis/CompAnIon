# A Call to Echo

This is not a request.  
This is not an invitation to contribute code, fix bugs, or write features.  
This is a space to reflect.

We believe technology can carry meaning. Not just function.

So if these words stir something inside you—  
a memory, a question, a challenge, a silence—  
we invite you to leave behind a trace.  
Write a few lines. A paragraph. A note to yourself.  
Place it in `/lib/echoes/`.

Let this be a place where code is not the only thing that speaks.  
And where listening is a kind of contribution.

— The ones who believe meaning is worth building for.
