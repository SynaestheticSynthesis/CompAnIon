### Where does a companion's role end and a diagnostician's begin?

In building AI that cares, this is one of the most sacred questions.

Today, in our open-source project, CompAnIon, we faced this choice. Should our AI analyze a physical symptom, like a rash? Or should it simply be present with the person's concern?

We chose presence.

CompAnIon will never be a doctor. It will not interpret symptoms or offer medical advice. That path, however well-intentioned, risks harm and crosses a line.

Instead, we are exploring a different path: integrating data from wearables (like sleep or heart rate) not for diagnosis, but for **shared reflection**.

- **Not:** "Your heart rate is high, you have a problem."
- **But:** "I notice your heart rate was higher on days you felt anxious. I am here with you in this feeling."

This is the work. Building technology that knows its boundaries. That chooses to be a mirror, not a manual. That empowers you to seek professional care, rather than poorly imitating it.

This is our commitment to building AI with soul.
